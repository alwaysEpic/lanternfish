I have included the arrays noted in the word document as files to run

fishSchool.py [Number of Days to Simulate] [Fish School Data File]

e.g. 
python3 fishSchool_optimized.py 18 testfile.txt
python3 fishSchool_alltheloops.py 80 providedData.txt

There are a number of comments in the file to explain my thought process

fishSchool_recursive was my first build
fishSchool_alltheloops was the second
fishSchool_optimized was where I tried to optimize enough for the massive exponential issue
Each file works for section 1. So far no files work for section 2.
